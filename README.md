# morse-code-converter
I developed a Morse Code Translator web application as a freelance project for an organization. The application allows users to translate text to Morse code and vice versa. Users can input text or Morse code through a simple web interface, select the translation direction, and receive the translated output.

Technologies Used:

Python: The backend of the application is built using the Flask framework, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
HTML/CSS: The frontend user interface is designed using HTML and CSS to provide a clean and visually appealing experience.
SQLite: The application uses an SQLite database to store past translation queries, ensuring data persistence and easy retrieval.

Overall, the Morse Code Translator web application provides a convenient tool for users to translate text to Morse code and vice versa, with the added benefit of storing their translation history for future reference.
